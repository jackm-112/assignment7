CS2010 Lab Assignment 7

This program reads characters & words from a .txt file and creates a dictionary containing information on the frequency of each character, word, and line in it.

It also takes this data and creates a histogram to visually represent the frequency.

Regarding instructions to run the program, I will discuss with you in the lab and then amend this section afterwards.
